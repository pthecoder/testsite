				the agency provided early learning development to <br> 
				children ages 2 to 12. The agency provides local and <br> 
				remote learning with adult professional supervision. <br> 
				During this time our professional practioners <br> 
				discovered behavior and curriculum needs along with <br> 
				staff requesting additional training. There was a need <br> 
				for in home or remote one on one programming. Creel <br> 
				wanted to implement training for parents to utilize long <br> 
				term.
